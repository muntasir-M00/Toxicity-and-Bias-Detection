# Toxicity-and-Bias-Detection

# Natural Language Processing Toxicity Inference Engine

This project implements a production-ready text classification pipeline designed to analyze online comments and predict whether a text payload is safe or toxic. The system utilizes a machine learning architecture trained on real-world community commentary data and exposes its prediction capabilities via a web API interface.


## Project Structure

* `notebook.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the model optimization pipeline. Running this notebook trains the model and generates the necessary serialization assets.
* `app.py`: A modular FastAPI script that loads the serialized model assets and establishes the API routing infrastructure.
* `requirements.txt`: The text file specifying the exact system dependencies and library versions required for replication.

*Note: The `models/` directory and its underlying tracking files (`complex_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) are generated automatically on your local machine after executing the training notebook.*


## System Installation and Local Setup

To deploy the text classification infrastructure locally on your machine, follow these execution steps:

### 1. Project Directory Preparation
Clone or download the repository files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `notebook.ipynb`) into a dedicated workspace folder on your local file system.

### 2. Environment Dependency Installation
Open your operating system terminal, navigate directly into your project root directory, and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
